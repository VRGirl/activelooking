					<h4><strong>Part 1</strong></h4>
<h2><span style="color:#ff0000;">Before Web 2.0 </span></h2>
<p>After the emergence of commercial internet around 1994, rhetoric and composition scholars were uncertain how to incorporate<a href="https://activelooking.wordpress.com/emerging-practices/"> emerging new literacies </a>into the composition classroom. Cynthia Selfe and Richard Selfe, that same year, explain that “few composition programs or English departments… make a systematic effort to provide parallel instruction on technology issues as they touch on educational projects – stressing readings and discussions on technology criticism, or on the growing body of scholarship and research associated with computers and composition studies” (496). Writing about technology, as they show, was common enough, but writing <em>using</em> technology was a thing of the future. Over the next ten years, scholars sent out calls-to-action concerned about how to incorporate new literacies involving new modes of composition. Considering computer use a ‘functional’ literacy, Stuart Selber argues that “computer literacy is a vexing and ongoing problem even for those teachers of writing and communication who are aware of and interested in computer literacy” (471). Stuart encourages self-reflexivity among computer users and illustrates the importance of addressing the ways in which computers help us to communicate, as well as limit us. He wants us to be aware of “the various rhetorics that inform the design of literacy technologies” (485), and to be able to negotiate over the multiple discourses what new technologies afford. Similarly, Mary Hocks claims that “new technologies simply require new definitions of what we consider writing” (630), though redefining writing is turning out to be anything but simple. Hocks offers three key features of digital rhetoric: audience stance, transparency, and hybridity. All three concepts encourage interactivity and interplay in various ways. They have the potential to disrupt traditional modes of print-based writing and put the student in the position of both critic and designer. In their article titled “Infrastructure and Composing: The <i>When</i> of New-Media Writing,” DeVoss, Cushman and Grabill argue that “if students are to be effective and critical new-media composers, they should be equipped with ways in which they can consider and push at practices and standards in strategic ways” (16). Here we can see the critic/designer dichotomy emerging in a more naturalized way. Though DeVoss et. al. are largely discussing the invisibility of the infrastructure involved in storage of new media projects, their call-to-action is no less pertinent than those that came before.</p>
<h4>Part 2</h4>
<h2><span style="color:#ff0000;">Process</span></h2>
<p>In a call-to-action involving a change in how we view process, Kathleen Blake Yancey uses the metaphor of tectonic shifting to describe the changes composition scholars face with added literacies in her article “Made Not Only in Words: Composition in a New Key.” Yancey claims that “literacy today is in the midst of a tectonic change” (298). She illustrates the shifting properties of composition with the addition of image as part of the text, rather than simply punctuating the written text. She claims that we have already shifted to the digital, but have forgotten to question the outdated models of process. She observes that “what’s interesting is that regardless of the changes that are advocated as we attempt to create a post-process composition curriculum, most (not all but most) attempt this without questioning or altering the late-20<sup>th</sup>-century basis of composition” (309).</p>
<p>An important shift toward process began with Janet Emig’s 1971 study called <i>The Composing Process of Twelfth Graders</i>, in which Emig performed a case study on eight twelfth grade writers from several levels and several backgrounds. Using the ‘compose aloud’ protocol, Emig found that students write using a prewriting-planning-writing-revising model of composing. The model is linear and much of it is labeled by Emig as ‘school sponsored’ and not practices students might perform on their own. Ten years later, Linda Flowers and John R. Hayes expand on this model devising their own Cognitive Process model, and using the same think-aloud protocol. Much of their findings involve what they call goal-setting, in which writers set both long and short-term writing goals which break down into sub-goals as they compose. This model is not as linear as Emig’s, but it does favor hierarchy and a process involving steps. The think-aloud protocol has been heavily criticized as disrupting participant writing, and the Cognitive Process model has been criticized as too systematic, and simplistic with little to no actual practical application. From this emerged Marilyn Cooper’s social and ecological model in which features “intuitively developed… dynamic interlocking systems which structure the social activity of writing”( 367-368), based on the idea that writing is part of a post-structural social system.</p>
<p>Shifting even further away from the linear cognitive models, Gary Hatch criticizes the Flower and Hayes model as attributing “writing as a type of problem-solving thinking” (246), which teaches that bad writing is essentially bad thinking. Instead, he claims that writing is a set of learned behaviors and that bad writing is simply a bad behavior – behavior that can be relearned (244). If Cooper and Hatch are correct, that writing is a social and behavioral, doesn’t it make sense to revisit and revise the old models we’ve been working with for too long? In her criticism of process, Yancey asks this question: “If we believe writing is social, shouldn’t the system of circulation – the paths that the writing takes – extend beyond and around the single path from student to teacher” (310-311)? She argues for an expansion on the model of process and calls for a revision of the classroom to include new skill sets for both students and instructors.</p>
<h4><strong>Part 3</strong></h4>
<h2><span style="color:#ff0000;">After Web 2.0</span></h2>
<p>Before Web 2.0, Diana George, in her article “From Analysis to Design,” questions the nature of visual communication and the roll of the student and her call is answered by Daniel Anderson and his argument for the reconfiguration of the teaching environment. Anderson proposes a construction site based classroom in which students are encouraged to experiment with composition. He claims that “the construction site is intimately concerned with innovation, looking toward technologies as agents that bring people and concerns together. It is also a site of risk and experimentation” (42). He cites the New London Group’s list of interconnected literacies to include linguistic, visual, audio, gestural, and spatial literacies (41), and argues for the integration of these literacies in the new media classroom. Anderson recommends accessible ‘low-bridge’ technologies that are free to the student and require no extra equipment such as cameras or pricey software. He stands behind a social, interactive model of composition “because the making that occurs through the interplay of things and humans yields creative and personal transformation” (44). Anderson does not discuss the old linear process model. Instead, he offers challenges to motivation that include intellectually engaging composition assignments.</p>
<p>In an attempt to answer questions concerning how to shift to a process of new media based, multimodal productions, Megan Fulwiler and Kim Middleton, in their article, “After Digital Storytelling,” claim that “the move from page to screen in our current information age is an epistemological shift that opens up new ways of reading, writing, representing and understanding that will, by necessity, be grounded in the ontological actions of the new media era” (39-40). They chose video as a “paradigmatic example of a multimodal text” (40) because it involves composite layers of image, sound, text, and added effects. Using two case studies, Fulwiler and Middleton uncover pitfalls in multimodal production. One of the more interesting challenges is the a reliance on the old linear models of process. Using the Center for Digital Storytelling (CDS) to help their students build narrative videos, Fulwiler and Middleton found that even this digital format used a linear process of script/film/edit – a holdover from the process model prewrite/write/revise. In a more up-to-date call-to-action, Fulwiler and Middleton argue that “teachers need to reconsider not only the kinds of texts we teach, but also <i>how </i>we teach the new processes associated with new media texts” (42). They explain two new processes called <a href="https://activelooking.wordpress.com/composite/">‘compositing</a>,’ or layering multiple modes, and ‘new recursivity,’ or the process of looping back to watch and self-assess during the building/editing phase of video production.</p>
<p>As we move into the future of composition, it is clear that writing programs will become increasingly multimodal and so I aim to <a href="https://activelooking.wordpress.com/gap/">address the gap</a> by proposing a social process based skill called <a href="https://activelooking.wordpress.com/active-looking/">Active Looking</a> which draws on these calls-to-action, and encourages students to act as a community of composers, advising and motivating one another in an environment that encourages experimentation – a composition construction site, as Anderson describes it.</p>
