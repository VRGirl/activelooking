      <strong>Look.</strong><br />
      Do you know what you are looking at?<br />
      Are you aware of what you are not looking at?<br />
      Watch.<br />

      Are you aware of what you are watching?<br />
      What’s the difference between watching and looking?<br />
      Does one exist?<br />

      When we watch, we consume. Watching is a passive construction of our time. <br />
      Does meaning making happen even though it is not the sole occupation of passive consumption? <br />
      When we look, is making meaning the primary focus? How do we know? Can we measure meaning making?<br />

      <br />
      We would definitely not say these children are watching, but looking, as they learn. <br />
      As an instructor of First Year Composition in the university system, <br />
      I ask my students to watch several videos a semester. <br />
      It’s rare that I have time to show a video more than once, <br />
      and I have never asked for anything other than a discussion, <br />
      or an analysis of its meaning. <br />
      But what happens when instructors ask students to look closely AT and THROUGH a multimodal text?<br />
      As Richard Lanham discusses in his text Electronic Word, <br />
      “The textual surface has become permanently bistable. <br />
      We are always looking first AT it then THROUGH it, <br />
      and this oscillation creates a different implied ideal of decorum; <br />
      both stylistic and behavioral” (267). <br />
      Could an actively close look at multimodal texts, such as video,<br />
      lead to an exposure of the composited elements involved in all modes of composition? <br />
      This non-linear,interactive essay presents a three-part literature review to reveal <br />
      a need for a new pedagogical term I call Active Looking, which is a form of <br />
      critical analysis meant specifically for the multimodal classroom, <br />
      based around emerging practices in college composition.
